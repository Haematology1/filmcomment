Dear Samantha,

I hope this message finds you well in sunny San Diego. It's hard to believe it's been almost six years since you walked across the stage at The Master's College, now The Master's University, with your degree in Business Administration (marketing). Time truly does fly!

As we approach the centennial year of TMU in 2027, we are filled with gratitude for the Lord's faithfulness and the unwavering dedication of our alumni community. We are reaching out to you today with an exciting invitation and a heartfelt request.

Firstly, we would be thrilled to welcome you back to campus for a private tour. So much has changed since 2016, and we would love for you to see the growth and transformation that has taken place. Most notably, we are in the planning stages of constructing a new chapel, a symbol of the authority and sufficiency of His Word, and an expression of the institution's unwavering dedication to Him. This Chapel of the Master will stand at the heart of campus as a public declaration of the resolve of The Master's University to champion Christ and Scripture until He returns.

Secondly, we are reaching out to our alumni community to ask for your support in making this chapel a reality. As a recovery of the lordship of Christ in architecture, this chapel will be no mere building, but a memorial to God's faithfulness. For the first time in nearly a century, a distinctly protestant educational institution will have the opportunity to join with the saints of old in constructing a building that proclaims the transcendence of God and timelessness of truth.

We understand that everyone's capacity to give is different, but we firmly believe that every gift, no matter the size, makes a difference. Your contribution would not only support the construction of the chapel but also the mission of TMU to empower students for a life of enduring commitment to Christ, biblical fidelity, intellectual growth, and lasting contribution to the Kingdom of God worldwide.

Thank you for considering this request, Samantha. We are grateful for your connection to TMU and look forward to hopefully seeing you on campus soon.

Here at The Master's College, we're preparing for a significant milestone - our Centennial Celebration in 2027. As we reflect on the past and look forward to the future, we're reminded of the enduring commitment to Christ and Scripture that has been the cornerstone of our institution. 

One of the most exciting projects we're undertaking as part of this celebration is the construction of a new chapel. This chapel will be no mere building, but a memorial to God's faithfulness, a symbol of the authority and sufficiency of His Word, and an expression of our unwavering dedication to Him. For generations to come, this chapel will stand at the heart of campus as a public declaration of the resolve of The Master's University to champion Christ and Scripture until He returns. This is the Chapel of the Master.
